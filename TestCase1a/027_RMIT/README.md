-Both SA and SST-kw turbulence models used the Spalart-Shur correction for curvature.  

-For SA model a pseudo-transient formulation is used with a pseudo-transient time-step of 5e-4 s.

-For SST-kw model convergence for alpha = 3 and 3.1 deg was challenging given global flowfield instability. Pseudo-transient formulation was also used with pseudo-transient time-step ranging between 1e-4 s and 1e-6 s.

-Converged steady-state solutions were not achieved using sst-kw for the grid level 4, alpha = 3 and 3.1 deg.

-Convergence data was not recorded for SST-kw runs.
